Deprecated
======================

This repository hosts the legacy versions of the Spring Boot add-on for Vaadin 10 - 22.
Since Vaadin 23, the code for the Spring Boot add-on has been migrated to the 
[Flow](https://github.com/vaadin/flow) repository:
* Issues and pull requests related to the Flow and Spring Boot integration for Vaadin 23 or newer should be created in https://github.com/vaadin/flow
* The Spring add-on will continue to be released from this code base for the maintenance versions of Vaadin Platform (14.8 and 22). Pull requests targeting this should go to this repository (see table below for the correct target branch).
