/**
 * Interface defining an event bus. This event bus infrastructure complements the
 * {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationEventPublisher} in the following ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Events propagate from parent buses to children</li>
 * <li>Events are scoped</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are four event scopes, and therefore four event bus types (each with their own sub interface):
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link EventScope#APPLICATION} events are published to the entire application.</li>
 * <li>{@link EventScope#SESSION} events are published to the current session.</li>
 * <li>{@link EventScope#UI} events are published to the current UI.</li>
 * <li>{@link EventScope#VIEW} events are published to the current view.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The event buses are chained in the following way:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Application events are propagated to the session event bus.</li>
 * <li>Session events are propagated to the UI event bus.</li>
 * <li>UI events are propagated to the view event bus.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Furthermore, {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationEventPublisher} events can be propagated to any event bus
 * by using {@link org.vaadin.spring.events.support.ApplicationContextEventBroker}.
 * <p>
 * You select which {@code EventBus} implementation to inject by using the corresponding interface. For example, to
 * inject the UI-scoped event bus, you would use:
 * <code>
 * &#64;Autowired UIEventBus myUIScopedEventBus;
 * </code>
 * With this implementation, you can subscribe to and publish events of the application, session and UI scopes (see
 * {@link #publish(EventScope, Object, Object)}).
