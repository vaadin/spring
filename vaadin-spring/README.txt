Vaadin Spring
======================

Vaadin Spring is the official Spring integration for Vaadin Framework version 7.

Getting started
----
See the tutorial at https://vaadin.com/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Vaadin+Spring .

See also the companion add-on Vaadin Spring Boot.

Migrating from vaadin4spring
----
Vaadin Spring contains a subset of the functionality of the add-on vaadin4spring.
The community add-on vaadin4spring will be updated to extend Vaadin Spring to provide additional functionality not present in Vaadin Spring.

As the naming of packages and some annotations have changed, the following renames and import updates are typically required for migration:
* org.vaadin.spring -> com.vaadin.spring (for the annotations and classes included in Vaadin Spring)
* @VaadinUI -> @SpringUI
* @VaadinView -> @SpringView

Note also that the ui parameter of @VaadinView now also covers the subclasses of the listed UI classes.

Issue tracking

small PRs as possible and fix only one issue per PR.
