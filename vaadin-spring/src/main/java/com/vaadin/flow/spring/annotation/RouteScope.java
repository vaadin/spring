/**
 * The lifecycle of a {@link RouteScope @RouteScope} component is controlled by
 * route navigation.
 * <p>
 * Every scoped bean belongs to one router component owner. It can be a
 * {@link Route @Route}, or a {@link RouterLayout}, or a
 * {@link HasErrorParameter HasErrorParameter}. Beans are qualified by
 * {@link RouteScopeOwner @RouteScopeOwner} to link with their owner.
 * <p>
 * Until owner remains active, all beans owned by it remain in the scope.
 * <p>
 * When a scoped bean is a router component, an owner can be any ancestor
 * {@link RouterLayout}, or the bean itself. Without the {@link RouteScopeOwner}
 * annotation the scope effectively behaves as prototype scope.
