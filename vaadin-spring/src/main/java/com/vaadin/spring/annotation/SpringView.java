/**
 * Annotation to be placed on {@link com.vaadin.navigator.View}-classes that
 * should be handled by the {@link SpringViewProvider}.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is also a stereotype annotation, so Spring will automatically
 * detect the annotated classes. By default, this annotation also puts the view
 * into the {@link com.vaadin.spring.annotation.ViewScope view scope}. You can
 * override this by using another scope annotation, such as
 * {@link com.vaadin.spring.annotation.UIScope the UI scope}, on your view
 * class. <b>However, the singleton scope will not work!</b>
 * <p>
 * This is an example of a view that is mapped to an empty view name and is
 * available for all UI subclasses in the application:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;SpringView(name = &quot;&quot;)
 * public class MyDefaultView extends CustomComponent implements View {
 *     // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This is an example of a view that is only available to a specified UI
 * subclass:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;SpringView(name = &quot;myView&quot;, ui = MyUI.class)
 * public class MyView extends CustomComponent implements View {
 *     // ...
