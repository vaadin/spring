/**
 * Stereotype annotation for Spring's {@code @Scope("vaadin-view)}. The
 * lifecycle of a bean in this scope starts when a user navigates to a view that
 * refers to the bean, and ends when the user navigates out of the view (or the
 * Vaadin UI itself is destroyed). Please note that the
 * {@link com.vaadin.navigator.View class} itself must also be in this scope. In
 * other words, it is <b>not</b> possible to use view scoped beans inside a
 * prototype or {@link com.vaadin.spring.annotation.UIScope UI} scoped view.
